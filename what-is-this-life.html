    <h4>What is this life?</h4>
    <h5>Course: Digital Studio</h5>
    <p class="textcolumn">Too often we find ourselves struggling to live in the present. We prioritize the little things and worry too much. We forget to appreciate the things that matter. In my film, I aim to capture our current state as a society and what we are missing – what is truly important. “What is this Life” is driven by writer W. H. Davies’ poem “Leisure”, which acknowledges the negligence our society has towards nature and simple pleasures despite our unique ability to care deeply. I used strong music and quick transitions throughout this film with the hope of showing viewers that the things that matter, the things we disregard, are beautiful and vast. They are fulfilling and necessary, yet they are overlooked as quickly as they are seen in this piece. I certainly rediscovered an appreciation for the world around me, the joy, and the love I feel towards others. I hope those who view this film share my experience.</p>
