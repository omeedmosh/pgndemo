      <h4>Cardboard Stag</h4>
      <h5>Course: 3D Design</h5>
      <p class="textcolumn">This project tasked us with producing a mechanically-capable bug using cardboard and wooden dowels. We had the opportunity to study real bugs, in my case, a stag beetle, and used it as a guide as we proceeded with the project. To approach this project differently, I treated the cardboard as a sculpting material, similar to stone. First, I stacked several slabs of cardboard into a large block and proceeded to "chisel" it down into components that were connected by joints, giving it the range of motion of a real stag beetle. The process of chiseling this piece was done using sanding machines, and the entire bug was only assembled once all components were finished.</p>
