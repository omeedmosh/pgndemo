      <h5>Course: High School</h5>
        
      <p class="textcolumn">This art project was pursued during a high school drawing course. We were tasked with drawing a self portrait that displayed us wearing articles that were a play on the extravagance of historical portrait attire. It was made with charcoal on paper.</p>
