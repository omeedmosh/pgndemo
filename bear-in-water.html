      <h4>Bear in Water</h4>
      <h5>Course: High School</h5>
      <p class="textcolumn">This piece was made while taking a high school ceramics course. I was tasked with using new clay techniques to create a creative sculpture. I have always been fascinated by bears and chose to present one in a way that displays both the dangerous and delightful aspects of the beast. As it glides through the water, its beauty can be admired, but it can also be seen as a hunter ready to charge after its prey.</p>
