      <h4>Treasured Tears Package Design</h4>
      <h5>Course: Word and Image I</h5>
        
      <p class="textcolumn">This assignment tasked us with creating an icon set based on a specific theme. Familiar with medical iconography and its common lack of personality and positivity, I chose to develop a set of my own that embodied a more lighthearted characteristic while still maintaining clear meanings. Hopefully, those who experience it in a medical setting would find it beneficial for their experience.</p>
