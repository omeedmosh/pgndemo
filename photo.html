      <h5>Personal Project</h5>
      <p class="textcolumn">I photographed this image while traveling through Canada. I wanted to capture the movement of people in a way that reveals our society's shared approach to a routine and often boring life. The escalator in this image acts as a motif for a journey to a higher realization, where life, when looking back, is simple and shouldn't be taken so seriously.</p>
