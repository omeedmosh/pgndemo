      <h4>Medical Icon Set</h4>
      <h5>Course: Digital Studio</h5>
        
      <p class="textcolumn">This assignment tasked us with creating an icon set based off of a specific theme. Familiar with medical iconography and its common lack of personality and positivity, I chose to develop a set of my own that embodied a more lighthearted charateristic while still maintaining clear meanings. Hopefully, those the experience of those that would see it in a medical setting would find it beneficial for their experience.</p>
